You will learn how to build and derive insights from these models using R, Python, and Azure Machine Learning.\r\n\r\nThis GitHub repository contains the lab files for the course.\r\nIf you'd like to attend the course, sign up for free on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/principles-machine-learning-microsoft-dat203-2x#!).",
